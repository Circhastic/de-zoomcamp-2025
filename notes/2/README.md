## Week 2 Notes : Kestra Workflow Orchestration

[Helps make cron scheduling for you](https://crontab.guru/)
[Installing Kestra using Docker Compose](https://kestra.io/docs/installation/docker-compose)

[Goated Notes](https://github.com/ManuelGuerra1987/data-engineering-zoomcamp-notes/blob/main/2_Workflow-Orchestration-(Kestra)/README.md)

Data Lake - for storing structured and unstructured raw data (i.e. Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3)
Data Warehouse - for storing processed and clean data for querying.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use Airflow for workflow orchestration, however DE Zoomcamp 2025 has recently switched to Kestra as it much easier setting up out-of-the-box (I think).
