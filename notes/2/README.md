[Helps make cron scheduling for you](https://crontab.guru/)
[Installing Kestra using Docker Compose](https://kestra.io/docs/installation/docker-compose)

[Goated Notes for this Week](https://github.com/ManuelGuerra1987/data-engineering-zoomcamp-notes/blob/main/2_Workflow-Orchestration-(Kestra)/README.md)

Data Lake - for storing structured and unstructured raw data (i.e. Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3)

Data Warehouse - for storing processed and clean data for querying.

MD5 Hash - useful for creating unique row ids, especially useful for backfilling

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use Airflow for workflow orchestration, however for 2025, it has recently been switched to Kestra as it much easier setting up out-of-the-box (so far, I think).
